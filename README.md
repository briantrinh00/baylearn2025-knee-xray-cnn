# Knee X-ray Classification (BayLearn 2025)

This repository contains the code for my BayLearn 2025 submission:  
**"Attention-Augmented EfficientNetV2-L for Knee Osteoporosis Classification"**

It implements a two-stage training pipeline built on EfficientNetV2-L to classify knee X-ray images into three classes: **normal**, **osteopenia**, and **osteoporosis**, achieving a test accuracy of 96%.
